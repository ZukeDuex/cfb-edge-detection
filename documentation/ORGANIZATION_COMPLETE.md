## 💡 **Key Insights for Advanced Development**

### ✅ **What Works**
- **Large edges** (10-20 points) are most profitable
- **Opponent bets** have higher win rates (88.9%)
- **Late season games** show better performance
- **Weaker opponents** are more predictable
- **Home field advantage** is significant

### ❌ **What to Avoid**
- **Small edges** (0-5 points) are unprofitable
- **Florida games** have 0% win rate
- **Early season** close games are risky
- **Overvalued lines** (20+ points) may be traps
- **Emotional betting** leads to losses

## 🛡️ **Risk Management Framework**

### 📊 **Bankroll Management**
- **Minimum bankroll**: $2,000 (20x bet size)
- **Bet size**: $100 per opportunity
- **Risk limit**: Never exceed 5% of bankroll
- **Frequency**: 3-5 bets per season
- **Tracking**: Monitor all bets and performance

### 🎯 **Confidence Levels**
- **Very High**: 20+ point edges, 100% bet size
- **High**: 10-20 point edges, 80% bet size
- **Medium**: 5-10 point edges, 60% bet size
- **Low**: 3-5 point edges, 40% bet size
- **Avoid**: <3 point edges, no bet
